# Startup-Automation-Workflow [No Code]-

## Objective
Automate first-level startup operations (lead management, branding requests, and customer inquiries) to save time and ensure every incoming request gets routed correctly.

## Tech & Requirements
- **n8n** → workflow automation
- **Airtable** → database for leads + tracking status
- **Email APIs** → for automated responses

## Workflow Features
1. Lead Segmentation
- Categories: Website Design, Branding & Logos, Landing Page, Email Automation, Social Media Kit, Personal Branding Strategy, AI Chatbot, Workshop Request, General Inquiry.
- Stored in Airtable with status (new, in-progress, done) + extra tracking columns.

2. Automated Routing
- New form submission → automatically logged in Airtable.
- Conditional branching in n8n routes leads based on category.
- Sends personalized email replies with next steps.

3. Notifications & Updates
- Team notified (Slack/Email) of new leads.
- Airtable updated with response timestamps.

## Learnings
- No-code workflows like n8n can replace weeks of manual work for startups.
- Airtable is a flexible backend but needs strict conventions for scale.

## Future Improvements
- Add CRM integration (HubSpot, Notion, ClickUp).
- Track lead lifecycle beyond first response (follow-ups, conversions).
- Use AI (OpenAI/LLM) to draft more personalized replies based on inquiry text.
